# BankAccountManager
This is my first major assignment in my Object-Oriented Programming course. The purpose of this program is to allow 
a user(bank employee) to create accounts and add client information to them. The user can also withdraw/deposit,
display account details, perform monthly updates(monthly fees/interest)

# Things I learned
-I learned how to implement javadoc to my projects
-I gained a better understanding of inheritance and encapsulation
