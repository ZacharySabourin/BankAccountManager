# BankAccountManager
This is my first major assignment in my Object-Oriented Programming course. The purpose of this program is to allow 
a user(bank employee) to create accounts and add client information to them. The user can also withdraw/deposit,
display account details, perform monthly updates(monthly fees/interest)

# Things I learned
- I learned how to implement javadoc to my projects.
- I gained a better understanding of inheritance and encapsulation.
- I learned how to read information from a file and creating objects with said information.
- I learned how to output data to a file.
- I was able to implement very thorough error handling. Even creating my own custom exception.
